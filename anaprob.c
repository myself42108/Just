/*
Problem Statement: Python program to check given two strings are Anagram of each other or not .
    
    An anagram of a string is an  another string that contains the same characters but the order of characters can be different.
For example ,listen and silent are anagrams of each oter because all the characters in the string "listen" are present in string "silent".
So, listen and silent are anagrams of each other. 
     At First convert both strings to list of characters and sort them using sort() methid and check if both two list strings are equal print 
    strings are anagrams of each other ,else print strings are not anagrams of eachother.
